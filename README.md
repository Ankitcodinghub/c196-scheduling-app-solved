INTRODUCTION

As a competent mobile application developer, your understanding of mobile application structure and design will help you to develop applications to meet customer requirements. The following project to develop a student scheduler/student progress tracking application, will help you to apply these skills in a familiar, real-world scenario. This task will allow you to demonstrate your ability to apply the skills learned in the course.

You will develop a multiple-screen mobile application for a student to track terms, courses associated with each term, and assessment(s) associated with each course. The application will allow students to enter, edit, and delete term, course, and assessment data. It should provide summary and detailed views of courses for each term and provide alerts for upcoming performance and objective assessments. This application will use a SQLite database.

REQUIREMENTS

<em>Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of the submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. The similarity report that is provided when you submit your task can be used as a guide.</em>

You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.

Tasks may&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;be submitted as cloud links, such as links to Google Docs, Google Slides, OneDrive, etc., unless specified in the task requirements. All other submissions must be file types that are uploaded and submitted as attachments (e.g., .docx, .pdf, .ppt).

<strong>Note</strong>: The assessment must be submitted in an Android Studio project using Java as the programming language. External plugins and libraries are not allowed in the project.

<strong>Note</strong>: Submit your performance assessment by including all Android project files, APK, and signed apk files in one zipped.zip file.

<strong>Note</strong>: The zip file submission must also keep the project file and folder structure intact for the Android Studio IDE.

<li>Share notes via a sharing feature (either e-mail or SMS) that automatically populates with the notes.</li>
<li>Include features that allow the user to do the following for&nbsp;<em>each</em>assessment:</li>
<li>Add performance and objective assessments for&nbsp;<em>each</em>course, including the titles and end dates of the assessments.</li>
<li>Enter, edit, and delete assessment information.</li>
<li>Set alerts for start and end dates, that will trigger when the application is not running.</li>
<li>Design the following screen layouts, including appropriate GUI (graphical user interface) elements (e.g., navigation, input, and information) for&nbsp;<em>each</em>layout:</li>
</ol>
